DESCRIPTION					  *ExtractMatches-description*

This plugin ...

HOW IT WORKS								     *

SOURCE									     *

Implementation inspired by
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Copy_the_search_results_into_clipboard
Use case inspired from a post by Luc Hermitte at
    http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ef9zh/any_better_way_to_yank_all_lines_matching_pattern/

ALTERNATIVES								     *

One can employ a |sub-replace-expression| to capture the matches, as described
in
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9079561/how-to-extract-regex-matches-using-vim
The idea is to use the side effect of |add()| in the expression, and force an
empty return value from it through the inverse range of [1:0]. To avoid text
modification, we make the pattern match nothing by appending |/\zs|; with
this, \0 will be empty, so we have to capture the match as \1: >
    let t=[] | %s/\(fo*)\zs/\=add(t, submatch(1))[1:0]/g
Since this has the side effect of setting 'modified', anyway, we can
alternatively have add() return the last added element [-1]; this saves us
from the zero-width match and capture: >
    let t=[] | %s/fo*/\=add(t, submatch(0))[-1]/g

SEE ALSO								     *

- The |PatternsOnText.vim| plugin (vimscript #4602) provides commands that
  print, substitute, or delete certain duplicates or matches directly in the
  buffer.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The yankitute plugin (vimscript #4719) provides a similar
  :[range]Yankitute[register]/{pattern}/[string]/[flags]/[join] command.

USAGE							*ExtractMatches-usage*
								  *:GrepToReg*
:[range]GrepToReg[!] /{pattern}/[x]
:[range]GrepToReg[!] [{pattern}]
			Yank all lines in [range] that match {pattern} (or the
			last search pattern if omitted), with !: do not match,
			into register [x] (or the unnamed register).
							   *:YankMatchesToReg*
:[range]YankMatchesToReg[!] /{pattern}/[x]
:[range]YankMatchesToReg[!] [{pattern}]
			Yank text matching {pattern} (or the last search
			pattern if omitted) in [range] into register [x] (or
			the unnamed register). Each match is put on a new
			line. This works like "grep -o". With [!]: Yank only
			the first match in each line.
:[range]YankMatchesToReg[!] /{pattern}/{replacement}/[x]
			Grab text matching {pattern} (or the last search
			pattern if omitted) in [range], and put {replacement}
			into register [x] (or the unnamed register). {pattern}
			must not refer to the buffer (e.g. |/\%l|) and must
			not use |/\zs| or |/\ze| for this to work. You can
			refer to the match via |s/\&| and submatches (|s/\1|).
			match is put on a new line. The matches are simply
			concatenated without a newline character.
			With [!]: Yank only the first match in each line.
						     *:YankUniqueMatchesToReg*
:[range]YankUniqueMatchesToReg[!] /{pattern}/[x]
:[range]YankUniqueMatchesToReg[!] [{pattern}]
			Yank text matching {pattern} (or the last search
			pattern if omitted) in [range] into register [x] (or
			the unnamed register), but only once. Each match is
			put on a new line. With [!]: Yank only the first match
			in each line.
:[range]YankUniqueMatchesToReg[!] /{pattern}/{replacement}/[x]

								 *:PutMatches*
:[line]PutMatches[!] /{pattern}/
:[line]PutMatches[!] [{pattern}]
:[line]PutMatches[!] /{pattern}/{replacement}/
			Put text matching {pattern} (or the last search pattern
			if omitted) after [line] (default current line). Each
			match is put on a new line (except when {replacement}
			is specified; see |:YankMatchesToReg|). This works
			like "grep -o".
			With [!]: Put only the first match in each line.
			Cp. |:YankMatchesToReg|.
							   *:PutUniqueMatches*
:[line]PutUniqueMatches[!] /{pattern}/
:[line]PutUniqueMatches[!] [{pattern}]
:[line]PutUniqueMatches[!] /{pattern}/{replacement}/
			Put text matching {pattern} (or the last search pattern
			if omitted) after [line] (default current line). Each
			match is once put on a new line.
			With [!]: Put only the first match in each line.
			Cp. |:YankUniqueMatchesToReg|.

INSTALLATION					 *ExtractMatches-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ExtractMatches*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *ExtractMatches-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.012 or
  higher.
